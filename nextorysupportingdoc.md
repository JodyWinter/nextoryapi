# About the API
The Nextory API is the only way we communicate with the Nextory app backend. It is an internal API that is used by Nextory's app teams. Our API is designed around REST. It has predictable resource-oriented URLs, returns JSON responses and uses standard authentication and verbs.

# Documentation
Our API is defined using the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) v3.02. We refer to this as 'the definition'. This industry-standard model allows us to define how our API functions and what you should expect from it. We describe in detail what each endpoint does, each request parameter and all of their possible values, including their data types, formatting, rules, and whether or not they are required or optional. We also provide all of the errors and responses, along with schemas and sample data.

# Terminologies Used
We use 'account holder' not 'user' to describe the person who owns the account because an account can support more than one user via profiles. The term 'user' and 'profile' are used to refer to the actual person using the account via a profile. We say 'log in' and 'log out' to describe the actions of an existing user and 'sign up' to describe the creation of a new account.

# Standards and Ongoing Improvements
Our API was documented retrospectively so a few inconsistencies were picked up. For example, spelling errors (query 'helpfull' and get 'helpful' in the response). And subtle differences between common parameters ('sort' either uses 'relevance' as the default or in some cases 'popularity'). These will need to be fixed at the code level at some stage.

As a result, the technical writer doing the docs in 2021 could not use the re-usable components functionality available in the OAS as much as she would have liked. But this can be refined once some standards are put in place.

# Evaluating Responses
All responses are returned in JSON. In the definition, we provide an example of each response along with a response schema. The schema describes each property in the response in more detail including what each property contains, the data format of the values, whether each property is required or optional, and the structure.

The response example is typically a subset of all possible information returned from a request. The response schema describes all possible properties in the response. That's why we include both.

> **Important! Boolean Values in JSON Response Samples**
All "0" and "1" data values are shown as "false" and "true (respectively) because that is the only way the OAS handles booleans.

# Book Download
There is no specific endpoint for book downloads. The app gets a URL to download a book file in the NX-007 response ("url" in the "file" JSON object).

# Servers
All requests should use either the production or development root API URLs:

**Production** https://www.nextory.se/api/app/<module_name>/<API_version>/<br>
**Development** http://apptest.nextory.se:82/api/app/<module_name>/<API_version>/

# Modules
Each endpoint references a specific module. A module is the part of the backend system responsible for that endpoint. When a call reaches the backend, the value is checked then the API request is sent to the specified module. Examples are 'library' and 'catalog'.

# Mandatory Request Header Parameters
Since API version 6.4, the following required and optional parameters must be passed through the request header.

# Proper SynchSettings and Data Validation Rules for NX-0201 (POST /library-sync)

This table explains the validation rules for data sent to the server. If the server validation fails, pieces of data will not be added into the server synchsetting database.

# Status and Error Codes
Requests that can be successfully parsed by the backend will return a 200 OK HTTP status code. If something goes wrong in the server application logic, one of the error codes in the following table will be returned. Error codes are specific to our API. They are one layer above standard HTTP error codes. We use HTTP error codes for pure infrastructure problems only.
