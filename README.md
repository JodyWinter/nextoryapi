## About This Repository
This repo contains a cut-down version of the Nextory's API definition for the purposes of my professional tech writing portfolio. The full version is not publically accessible and is only viewable on request.

## Background
In April 2021, I decided to join Upwork to see who was asking for freelancers to document REST APIs. Nextory, an audio books and e-books streaming service based in Sweden, posted a job asking for someone to transform their MS Word information dump into a reference doc using the OpenAPI Specification 3.0 (OAS).

I'd been learning all the theory around documenting REST APIs for about a year, and so I decided to download Nextory's MS Word document and give it a go.

## Nextory's Response
To my delight, Nextory's head of engineering took a chance on me and asked me to continue working on the definition.

## About the API
The Nextory API is the only means of communication between the Nextory app and the backend that supports it. It is an internal API that is used by Nextory's app teams.

## About the Docs
No conceptual docs are needed (Getting Started, Code Samples, Authentication) because the API is consumed internally.

## About Me
I'm a senior technical writer based in Auckland, New Zealand who wants to move away from end-user docs to developer docs. REST APIs seem like a great place to start because I can provide a human and machine-readable API definition as well as conceptual docs that will make organisations' APIs more appealing to devs and decision-makers.
